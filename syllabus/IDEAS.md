Ideas for Econ 103
==================
- Student mini-lectures each class meeting
- Multiple small projects, one big project
- Pre-test on Econ 103 and basic R that counts for a grade (I may need to make them a review sheet, or have a TA do it)
- Reading quizzes at least once a week, maybe every class meeting?
- Mandatory attendence
- Assign students into groups based on background etc.
- Bring your laptop every time
