# Introduction
We'll use the package `stargazer` to generate pretty tables of results like the ones you see in journal articles.
Make sure to install this package before proceeding.

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(stargazer)
```

I chose to output my `.Rmd` file to a pdf using LaTeX, so I used the option `type = latex`. 
If you're using `html` you'll need to change this to `type = 'html'`.
If you want to see a "preview" of the table within R studio without compiling, choose `type = 'text'`.
```{r, results = "asis"}
stargazer(mtcars, type = 'latex', title = 'Descriptive Statistics')
```
