# Instructions
To give you and me a break, this week there is *no problem set*.
Instead, please submit Lab \#8 in lieu of a problem set.
This is a farily long lab, so you will almost certainly have to work on it outside of class.
As usual, submit your code and solutions as an RMarkdown document to canvas, including both `.Rmd` and `.html` files.
The collaboration policy is slightly different for this problem set, since you will work on at least part of it in class.
For the part you do in class, feel free to collaborate in any way that you please.
For the part that you do at home, please adhere to the *empty hands policy*.(See previous problem sets for details.)
Indicate on your write-up which portion you completed in class with your team and which portion you completed on your own outside of class.
