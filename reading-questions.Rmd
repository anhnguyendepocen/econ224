# Instructions
This document lists the reading assignments for Econ 224 along with the associated reading questions. 
For each reading assignment there will be an in-class quiz. 
The dates of these quizzes are listed below.
Quiz questions will be randomly selected from the reading questions listed on this document, so if you thoroughly prepare your answers in advance, you will be sure to get 100\% on each quiz of the semester.
The abbreviation *ISL* refers to "An Introduction to Statistical Learning" by James et al.\ while *MM* refers to "Mastering 'Metrics" by Angrist and Pischke.
Note that a complete answer to each of these questions requires at most a short paragraph, and more typically a few sentences.



## Quiz \#1: Thursday, August 30th -- ISL 2
1. We use $Y$ to denote the variable we want to predict and $X$ to denote a variable used to predict $Y$. List the different names that ISL uses interchangeably for $Y$. Do the same for $X$. 
2. Define reducible and irreducible error. Which of these errors do the authors of ISL say that their book is focused on minimizing?
3. What is a parametric method? In particular, what are the two steps involved in using a parametric method? Give an example.
4. Contrast parametric and nonparametric methods. What is the main advantage and disadvantage of each?
5. What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?
6. What is the difference between regression and classification? 
7. Explain the difference between *training* MSE and *test* MSE. Which of these do we want our statistical learning method to minimize?
8. Define bias and variance. How would we expect each of these quantities to change as we increase the flexibility of our statistical learning model?
9. In place of MSE, what measure of prediction accuracy is used in classification problems?
10. What is a Bayes classifier?
11. Is it possible for a statistical learning model to attain an error rate *lower* than the Bayes error rate? Why or why not?
12. Briefly explain the K-nearest Neighbors classifier. What trade-off involved in choosing a value of K?

## Quiz \#2: Tuesday, September 4th -- MM Intro & 1.1
1. Define the term *ceteris paribus*.
2. What is the "fundamental empirical conundrum" when trying to learn the causal effect of health insurance on health?
3. In the NHIS example, what is the *outcome*, what is the *treatment*, who makes up the *treatment group* and who makes up the *control group*?
4. List some of the major differences in demographic characteristics between the insured and uninsured in the NHIS.
5. Briefly explain the idea of *potential outcomes* using a simple example. What notation do we use to represent these?
6. The difference in average health by insurance can be written as the sum of two terms. What are they? Briefly explain the meaning of each and relate them to the potential outcomes notation.
7. What is the relevance of the LLN for random assignment?
8. Explain the meaning of $E[Y_i |D_i = d]$.
9. Briefly explain how random assignment eliminates selection bias. Explain both in words and using the notation of conditional expectation and potential outcomes.
10. What are the two key findings of the RAND HIE?

## Quiz \#3: Thursday, September 6th -- MM 1.2 & Appendix
1. What are some limitations of using the results of the RAND HIE to extrapolate to the causal effect of increasing insurance coverage in the US today?
2. What was the OHP lottery and why was it carried out? Why does it provide evidence for the costs and benefits of insurance coverage for the currently uninsured?
3. Summarize the key findings of the OHP lottery.
4. Define the term *unbiased estimator*. Is the sample mean an unbiased estimator of something? If so, what?
5. Write down the formulas for the sample and population variance of $Y_i$. What does each of these measure? What Greek letter do we use to represent the population variance?
6. If we multiply $Y_i$ by a constant $c$, what happens to the variance? What happens to the standard deviation?
7. Define the term *standard error*. In terms of the relevant population parameters and sample size, what is the standard error of the sample mean?
8. Explain the difference between *standard error* and *estimated standard error*.
9. Explain how to construct an approximate 95\% confidence interval for a population mean based on the Central Limit Theorem.
10. Write down the formula for the standard error of a difference of sample means from independent populations if: (1) both populations have the same variance, (2) each population has a different variance.
